When I decided to learn how to use Zend Framework, I wanted a detailed tutorial to follow. I really wanted to build my 
own blog. So I googled until I came across a fantastically detailed and well explained online book by PÃ¡draic Brady 
called Survive the Deep End. Unfortunately, as of writing, it is still incomplete and has not been edited since 2009. 
So I followed the tutorial as far as it went and then I completed the code to suit my requirements. You are looking at 
the result so far.

My blog code includes:

    Display of a short version of all blogs
    Display of individual blogs
    Lists of most recent blogs
    Tag cloud
    Display of blogs by tag
    Commenting
    Subscription
    RSS feed
    Admin interface for adding/editing/hiding posts (utilises tinymce)

My blog code does not include:

    Unit testing
    Admin interface for adding/editing authors
    Documentation
    HTML5 - inprogress

Installation instructions:

    Knowledge of the LAMP stack is assumed
    Download my code from github
    Point your directory root to Lilypad_Zend_Framework_Blog/public
    Download Zend Framework version 1.x (http://www.zend.com/en/community/downloads)
    Download Blueprint Framework (http://blueprintcss.org/)
    Download Tinymce (http://www.tinymce.com/)
    Add or link <downloads>/ZendFramework-1.x.x/library/Zend to Lilypad_Zend_Framework_Blog/library
    Add or link <downloads>/tinymce to Lilypad_Zend_Framework_Blog/public/js
    Add or link <downloads>/ joshuaclayton-blueprint-css-xxxxxxx/blueprint to Lilypad_Zend_Framework_Blog/public/css
    Create a mysql database
    Run the script Lilypad_Zend_Framework_Blog/zend_blog.sql to set up your tables and base data
    Edit the relevant sections of Lilypad_Zend_Framework_Blog/config/application.ini (database connection, email, name etc)
    Navigate to <yoursite>/admin
    Username: admin
    Password: password
    Author credentials are stored in the author table
    You can view and edit a working demo at http://demo.lilypadstudio.net. The database is restored nightly, so feel 
    free to play!

To understand the code, check out Survive the Deep End as a starting point. This post is not a tutorial. It is intended 
to help anyone looking for a working Zend Framework Blog to pull apart and analyse. It is a work in progress and I would 
like to add the features I have listed as missing above. Feel free to use it as you wish. All I ask is that you credit 
me inconspicuaously, and feed back to me any improvements that you make, preferably using github. I am still learning.
